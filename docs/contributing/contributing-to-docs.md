# Contributing to documentation

We use [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/) for the documentation site you're reading right now.

## How to get started

1. Clone the `pylon-docs` repository: `git clone https://github.com/pylonmc/pylon-docs`
2. Install MkDocs using pip: `pip install mkdocs`
3. Install the MkDocs material theme: `pip install mkdocs-material`
4. Run the documentation website locally using `mkdocs serve`

## Deploying

Only core members can deploy the website.

1. Clone the `pylonmc.github.io` repository: `git clone https://github.com/pylonmc/pylonmc.github.io`
2. Deploy the site with `mkdocs gh-deploy --config-file ../pylon-docs/mkdocs.yml --remote-branch master`
