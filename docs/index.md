# Introduction
Pylon is a work-in-progress Minecraft Java plugin intended as a successor to [Slimefun](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4), in active development by a group of veteran Slimefun developers, contributors, and server administrators. [Join our Discord server](https://discord.gg/4tMAnBAacW) to find out more.

Pylon is split into two main parts: core and base. Pylon Core is a library which provides everything needed to make new content, while Pylon Base adds a bunch of new content. Pylon Core uses an addon system, much like Slimefun - in fact, Pylon Base is a Pylon addon. This means developers will be able to create their own addons and easily take advantage of Pylon's wealth of features.
