# What is Pylon?

Pylon is a work-in-progress Minecraft Java plugin intended as a successor to [Slimefun](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4), in active development by a group of veteran Slimefun developers, contributors, and server administrators. [Join our Discord server](https://discord.gg/4tMAnBAacW) to find out more.

Pylon is built using an addon system. All addons require the main Pylon plugin - Pylon Core - to work. This includes Pylon Base, the addon which adds all the default content. Developers can create their own Pylon addons.
