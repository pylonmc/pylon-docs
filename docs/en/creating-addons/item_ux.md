- Use a material that represents the item
- Description, then usage, then attributes
- Keep lore concise; people hate reading
- Describe what your item does, but not in so much detail that it's overbearing
- Come back to item lore and adjust it over time if you happen to think of an improvement
- Don't use colors excessively (avoid unecessary highlighting)
- Recipes should make logical sense
- Reflect recipes that can be reflected (eg: axes)
- The smelting time for a new furnace / blast furnace / smoker recipe should be the same as the smelting time for all items in vanilla, unless there's a good reason to make it different
- The material of a block should be the same as the material of the item
- Don't include lore just for the sake of writing something
- Ideally, it should be possible to figure out how to use the items from just the lore
- Don't use full stops at the end of lines
