## :tools: For server admins

### Performance

- :gear: Even huge multiblocks will have **almost zero** performance impact compared to a normal Pylon block
- :gear: Most of Pylon will eventually run asynchronously
- :gear: Performance is literally built into Pylon's design - systems like fluid pipes and cargo were designed from the ground up in the most performant way possible
- :gear: You will be able to limit the number of each type of block per player or per chunk
- :gear: Pylon will have many more performance options, such as making fluid pipes tick less often, or reducing tick rates of individual types of machines
- :gear: We plan to add a purpose-built profiler so you can see exactly what blocks & items are using the most CPU or memory

### Stability

- :gear: Easily disable any problematic blocks or items
- :gear: Pylon will refuse to start if it detects any configuration issues
- :gear: Blocks that throw errors will be safely unloaded
- :gear: Removing addons is safe, with all the data kept intact and restored if the addon is re-added
- :gear: Pylon data is stored **in the world data itself** - no need to keep extra backups

### Customisation

- :gear: The unlocks and costs of each research are configurable
- :gear: All recipes are configurable
- :gear: Most blocks and items have settings determining their tick rate, speed, diesel usage, etc

## :keyboard: For developers

### Addon development

- :gear: Pylon has first-class addon support; all the base content is added using an addon!
- :gear: Pylon supports addons written in Kotlin
- :gear: Blocks, items, recipes, guide pages, fluids, and entities are all easy and intuitive to add
- :gear: Pylon will have extensive high-level documentation on all the features it has to offer

!!! warning "Currently, addon development is not supported due to how rapidly Pylon is still changing."

## :question: Q&A

| Question | Answer |
| -------- | ------ |
| **How do I install Pylon?** | Read the installation guide at [https://pylonmc.github.io/installation/installing-pylon/](https://pylonmc.github.io/installation/installing-pylon/). Beware that **Pylon is still experimental and you should not run it outside of an expendable test server.** |
| **Will Pylon support Slimefun addons?** | No. Migrating from Slimefun to Pylon is non-trivial, and we advise addon developers to rewrite their addons entirely to better suit Pylon's progression and style rather than attempting to migrate them 1-to-1. |
| **What versions will Pylon support?** | We plan to keep each Pylon version compatible with the latest version of Minecraft at the time. To make it easier and faster for us to update, **each version of Pylon will only support one version of Minecraft.** This means you will need to use older versions of Pylon for older versions of Minecraft. Critical fixes will be backported. |
| **What server software can Pylon run on?** | Paper or paper forks only. Folia support may come later down the line. |
| **Will Pylon support bedrock (via Geyser)?** | Eventually, yes, but it is not a high priority and will be one of the last things added. Geyser is very hard for a project like this to support and there will be some jank. |
| **When will Pylon be ready?** | See the 'Provisional Timeline' section above |
